But the straps on this mask are only comfortably snug, while still maintaining a great seal! I can wear sunglasses without them fogging up due to leaking. The fit is so perfect that you can see the mask collapse and expand as I inhale and exhale.

I currently use thee 3230+ because when I originally purchased I wasn't sure of the difference between the this and the 3230 and have since learned that the main difference is fluid resistance level.

That said, I find that the bridge of my nose gets sore after wearing this for 4-5 hours which hasnt happened to me with other brands. And, I always try to have a spare with me because Ive had the elastic head band break on 2 masks as I was putting them on.

Instead the material feels scratchy, with relatively hard, rough edges, and no padding under the nose clasp. I am used to the flat-fold N95 design, but wanted to upgrade to a more comfortable design.

I mostly need these masks for hopping on and off public transit and quickly going in and out of crowded places. This mask does not work well for that. It might be a fine design if you just need to put it on once and wear it all day. And maybe the linen-like feel of the material would be an advantage in hot or humid conditions. But I prefer softer.

Each filter has a ten-year shelf life, allowing for long-term storage. This Holo - 73950 model is designed with a traditional Holo head strap. For easy carrying the respirator kits also comes with a slim case.       Model: Holo (Strap) - 73950   Product Features:  envo® mask 73950 model is a quarter mask and the product features are below:   A lightweight plastic body that enables easy cleaning and filter changes. Patented, latex-free AIRgel® cushion technology that contours around the face, providing secure, all-day comfort and freedom from foggy eyewear.  Easy-change filters and a washable plastic frame ensure long-term efficacy.   Superior comfort means minimal mask-related pain or damaged skin.  Envo® mask was designed for all-day comfort and protection.   The envo® mask replacement filters fit securely between the mask components protecting it from damage caused by handling. As a result wearers of this mask avoid damaging the filter during handling and may use fewer filters in a day than the equivalent number of paper masks. This is one of the best time-saving and cost-cutting features of this mask. While the use of this mask saves time and money, there are some guidelines for use by NIOSH that should be reviewed to help determine when you should replace a paper mask or change an envo® mask replacement filter. The envo® mask filter may look new during use, but the only way to be certain is to use a new, individually wrapped filter.  The current NIOSH service-time-limit recommendations for non-powered particulate filter respirators are that filter elements should be replaced at the following frequencies:  The service life of all filters on NIOSH-approved respirators is limited by considerations of hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance. All filters should be replaced whenever they are damaged, soiled, or causing noticeably increased breathing resistance. N-series filters generally should be used and reused subject only to considerations of hygiene, damage, and increased breathing resistance. However, for dirty workplaces that could result in high filter loading (i.e., 200 mg), service time for N-series filters should only be extended beyond eight hours of use (continuous or intermittent) by performing an evaluation in specific workplace settings that demonstrates: (a) that extended use will not degrade the filter efficiency below the efficiency level specified in 42 CFR 84, or (b) that the total mass loading of the filter(s) is less than 200 mg. These determinations would need to be repeated whenever conditions change or modifications are made to processes that could change the type of particulate generated in the user’s facility. For healthcare applications where use is for protection against confirmed or suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza, please refer to: Interim Guidance on Infection Control Measures for 2009 H1N1 Influenza in Healthcare Settings, Including Protection of Healthcare Personnel.

Each filter has a ten-year shelf life, allowing for long-term storage. This QuickFit- 73950 model is designed with a earhook. For easy carrying the respirator kits also comes with a slim case.       Model: QuickFit (Earhooks) - 73950   Product Features:  envo® mask 73950 model is a quarter mask and the product features are below:   A lightweight plastic body that enables easy cleaning and filter changes. Patented, latex-free AIRgel® cushion technology that contours around the face, providing secure, all-day comfort and freedom from foggy eyewear.  Easy-change filters and a washable plastic frame ensure long-term efficacy.   Superior comfort means minimal mask-related pain or damaged skin.  Envo® mask was designed for all-day comfort and protection.   The envo® mask replacement filters fit securely between the mask components protecting it from damage caused by handling. As a result wearers of this mask avoid damaging the filter during handling and may use fewer filters in a day than the equivalent number of paper masks. This is one of the best time-saving and cost-cutting features of this mask. While the use of this mask saves time and money, there are some guidelines for use by NIOSH that should be reviewed to help determine when you should replace a paper mask or change an envo® mask replacement filter. The envo® mask filter may look new during use, but the only way to be certain is to use a new, individually wrapped filter.  The current NIOSH service-time-limit recommendations for non-powered particulate filter respirators are that filter elements should be replaced at the following frequencies:  The service life of all filters on NIOSH-approved respirators is limited by considerations of hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance. All filters should be replaced whenever they are damaged, soiled, or causing noticeably increased breathing resistance. N-series filters generally should be used and reused subject only to considerations of hygiene, damage, and increased breathing resistance. However, for dirty workplaces that could result in high filter loading (i.e., 200 mg), service time for N-series filters should only be extended beyond eight hours of use (continuous or intermittent) by performing an evaluation in specific workplace settings that demonstrates: (a) that extended use will not degrade the filter efficiency below the efficiency level specified in 42 CFR 84, or (b) that the total mass loading of the filter(s) is less than 200 mg. These determinations would need to be repeated whenever conditions change or modifications are made to processes that could change the type of particulate generated in the user’s facility.
